<H2>Engine Component Description - LD9</H2>


<A NAME="ss1-2574162">
<A HREF="#ss1-2574162">
<H3>Cylinder Head and Gasket </H3></A><p>The cylinder head is made of an aluminium alloy. The cylinder head uses cross-flow inlet and exhaust ports. A spark plug is located in the centre of each combustion chamber. The cylinder head houses the dual camshafts. </p>

<A NAME="ss2-2574162">
<A HREF="#ss2-2574162">
<H3>Crankshaft </H3></A><p>The crankshaft has eight integral weights which are cast with it for balancing. Oil holes run through the centre of the crankshaft to supply oil to the connecting rods, the bearings, the pistons, and the other components. The end thrust load is taken by the thrust washers installed at the centre journal. </p>

<A NAME="ss3-2574162">
<A HREF="#ss3-2574162">
<H3>Timing Belt </H3></A><p>The timing belt coordinates the crankshaft and the dual overhead camshafts and keeps them synchronised. The timing belt also turns the coolant pump. The timing belt and the pulleys are toothed so that there is no slippage between them. There are two idler pulleys. An automatic tensioner pulley maintains the timing belt's correct tension. The timing belt is made of a tough reinforced rubber similar to that used on the serpentine drive belt. The timing belt requires no lubrication. </p>

<A NAME="ss4-2574162">
<A HREF="#ss4-2574162">
<H3>Oil Pump </H3></A><p>The oil pump draws engine oil from the sump and feeds it under pressure to the various parts of the engine. An oil strainer is mounted before the inlet of the oil pump to remove impurities which could clog or damage the oil pump or other engine components. When the crankshaft rotates, the oil pump driven gear rotates. This causes the space between the gears to constantly open and narrow, pulling oil in from the sump when the space opens and pumping the oil out to the engine as it narrows.</p>
<p> At high engine speeds, the oil pump supplies a much higher amount of oil than required for lubrication of the engine. The oil pressure regulator prevents too much oil from entering the engine lubrication passages. During normal oil supply, a coil spring and valve keep the bypass closed, directing all of the oil pumped to the engine. When the amount of oil being pumped increases, the pressure becomes high enough to overcome the force of the spring. This opens the valve of the oil pressure regulator, allowing the excess oil to flow through the valve and drain back to the sump. </p>

<A NAME="ss5-2574162">
<A HREF="#ss5-2574162">
<H3>Sump </H3></A><p>The engine sump is mounted to the bottom of the cylinder block. The engine sump houses the crankcase and is made of cast aluminium. Engine oil is pumped from the sump by the oil pump. After it passes through the oil filter, it is fed through two paths to lubricate the cylinder block and cylinder head. In one path, the oil is pumped through oil passages in the crankshaft to the connecting rods, then to the pistons and cylinders. It then drains back to the sump. In the second path, the oil is pumped through passages to the camshaft. The oil passes through the internal passageways in the camshafts to lubricate the valve assemblies before draining back to the sump. </p>

<A NAME="ss6-2574162">
<A HREF="#ss6-2574162">
<H3>Exhaust Manifold </H3></A><p>A single four-port, rear-takedown manifold is used with this engine. The manifold is designed to direct escaping exhaust gases out of the combustion chambers with a minimum of back pressure. The oxygen sensor is mounted to the exhaust manifold.</p>

<A NAME="ss7-2574162">
<A HREF="#ss7-2574162">
<H3>Inlet Manifold </H3></A><p>The inlet manifold has four independent long ports and utilises an inertial supercharging effect to improve engine torque at low and moderate speeds. </p>

<A NAME="ss8-2574162">
<A HREF="#ss8-2574162">
<H3>Camshafts </H3></A><p>This engine is a dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) type, which means there are two camshafts. One camshaft operates the inlet valves, and the other camshaft operates the exhaust valves. The camshafts sit in journals on the top of the engine (in the cylinder head) and are held in place by camshaft caps. The camshaft journals of the cylinder head are drilled for oil passages. Engine oil travels to the camshafts under pressure where it lubricates each camshaft journal. The oil returns to the sump through drain holes in the cylinder head. The camshaft lobes are machined into the solid camshaft to precisely open and close the inlet and the exhaust valves the correct amount at the correct time. The camshaft lobes are oiled by splash action from pressurised oil escaping from the camshaft journals. </p>

<A NAME="ss9-2574162">
<A HREF="#ss9-2574162">
<H3>Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve </H3></A><p>The exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system is used to lower oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emission levels caused by high combustion temperatures. The main element of the system is the EGR valve which is operated electronically.</p>
<p> The EGR valve feeds small amounts of exhaust gas into the inlet manifold to decrease the combustion temperature. The amount of exhaust gas recirculated is controlled by the engine control module (ECM) in response to variations in engine load. If too much exhaust gas enters, combustion will not take place. For this reason, very little exhaust gas is allowed to pass through the valve, especially at idle.</p>
<p>The EGR valve is usually open under the following conditions: </p>
