<H2>Brake Assist System Description and Operation</H2>


<A NAME="ss1-697381">
<A HREF="#ss1-697381">
<H3>System Component Description</H3></A><p>The brake assist system consists of the following:</p><B>Brake Pedal:&nbsp;</B>Receives, multiplies and transfers brake system input force from driver.<br><br><B>Brake Pedal Pushrod:&nbsp;</B>Transfers multiplied input force received from brake pedal to brake booster.<br><br><B>Vacuum Brake Booster:&nbsp;</B>Uses source vacuum to decrease effort required by driver when applying brake system input force. At rest, source vacuum is applied to both sides of the vacuum diaphragm for single boosters, or to both sides of each of the diaphragms for tandem boosters. Return springs maintain the booster in a rest position. When brake system input force is applied, vacuum to the rear of the diaphragm(s) is cut off, and air at atmospheric pressure is admitted in its place. This provides a decrease in brake pedal effort required. When input force is removed, vacuum again replaces atmospheric pressure within the booster.<br><br><B>Vacuum Source:&nbsp;</B>Supplies force used by vacuum brake booster to decrease brake pedal effort. The primary source for vacuum is typically the vehicle's internal combustion engine. Some vehicles may use a vacuum pump to ensure and adequate supply of vacuum under various operating conditions, such as during cold start-up, heavy throttle, and high altitude.<br><br><B>Vacuum Pump Relay:&nbsp;</B>Vehicles equipped with a vacuum pump will typically be equipped with a relay used to provide voltage to the vacuum pump motor, when commanded by the powertrain controller.<br><br><B>Vacuum Monitoring System:&nbsp;</B>Provides a feedback voltage signal relative to the amount of vacuum available for the vacuum power brake booster. This typically consists of a vacuum sensor mounted either into the power vacuum brake booster, integrated with the vacuum check valve, or in-line within the vacuum hose. The sensor feedback is typically monitored by the powertrain control module(s).<br><br><B>Vacuum Source Control:&nbsp;</B>If equipped with a system to monitor available levels of vacuum for the brake assist system, the powertrain control module(s) typically perform the primary monitoring function. The powertrain controller will typically monitor the feedback signal of a vacuum sensor, as it relates to available vacuum at the vacuum power brake booster. The powertrain controller uses the information to make sure available vacuum remains above predetermined levels. If additional vacuum is required, the powertrain controller may reactivate engine cylinders, if equipped, or command a vacuum pump ON, if equipped, and/or may alter the operation of various other engine controls and devices, as necessary.<br><br><B>Vacuum Source Delivery System:&nbsp;</B>Enables delivery and retention of source vacuum for vacuum brake booster. This typically consists of a vacuum check valve and a vacuum hose or pipe. If a vacuum pump is used, additional check valves may be used.<br><br>
<A NAME="ss2-697381">
<A HREF="#ss2-697381">
<H3>System Operation</H3></A><p>Brake system input force from the driver is multiplied by the brake pedal and transferred by the pedal pushrod to the hydraulic brake master cylinder. Effort required to apply the brake system is reduced by the operation of the vacuum brake booster.</p>
<p>When brake system force is applied, vacuum to the rear of the diaphragm(s) is cut off, and air at atmospheric pressure is admitted in its place. The vacuum acts to pull the diaphragm(s) forward, while the atmospheric pressure acts to push from behind. As a result, the amount of effort required by the driver is reduced. When input force is removed, vacuum again replaces atmospheric pressure within the vacuum servo unit to help return the booster to rest. Return springs maintain the system in a rest position.</p>
<p>If the vehicle is equipped with a vacuum monitoring system, the powertrain control module(s) typically will alter powertrain functions and/or command the vacuum pump ON, if equipped, to provide for the vacuum needs of the brake assist system, as operating conditions warrant.</p>
