<OL><LI TYPE="1">Raise and support the vehicle.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">Mark the location of the wheels to the wheel studs and mark the specific vehicle position on each tyre and wheel - LF, LR, RF, RR.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">Remove the tyre and wheel assemblies from the vehicle.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">Closely inspect each tyre for proper and even bead seating.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">If any of the tyre beads were not properly or evenly seated, reseat the tyre bead, then proceed to step&nbsp;6. Refer to <a href="92081186.en.html">Tyre and Wheel Removal and Installation</a> .</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">Mount a tyre and wheel assembly on a spin-type wheel balancer.</LI>
<p>Locate the tyre and wheel assembly on the balancer with a cone through the back side of the centre pilot hole.</p>

<BR><IMG src="../../../../graphic-pool/1/76/9/176957.png" alt="176957">
<BR><LI TYPE="1">Wrap the outer circumference of each tyre with tape&nbsp;(1) in the centre tread area.</LI>
<p>Wrapping the tread with tape allows for a smooth and accurate reading of radial runout to be obtained.</p>
<LI TYPE="1">Position the dial indicator on the taped portion of the tyre tread such that the dial indicator is perpendicular to the tyre tread surface.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">Slowly rotate the tyre and wheel assembly one complete revolution in order to find the low spot.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">Set the dial indicator to zero at the low spot.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">Slowly rotate the tyre and wheel assembly one more complete revolution and measure the total amount of radial runout.</LI>

<p><b>Specification</b>
<br>Maximum tyre and wheel assembly radial runout - measured off-vehicle: 1.27&nbsp;mm (0.050&nbsp;in)</p>

<BR><IMG src="../../../../graphic-pool/1/76/9/176958.png" alt="176958">

<LI TYPE="1">Set the dial indicator to zero at the low spot.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">Slowly rotate the tyre and wheel assembly one more complete revolution and measure the total amount of lateral runout. Ignore any jumps or dips due to sidewall splices and attain an average runout measurement.</LI>

<p><b>Specification</b>
<br>Maximum tyre and wheel assembly lateral runout - measured off-vehicle: 1.27&nbsp;mm (0.050&nbsp;in)</p>
<LI TYPE="1">Repeat steps 6&nbsp;through&nbsp;15 until all of the tyre and wheel assembly radial and lateral runout measurements have been taken.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">If ANY of the tyre and wheel assembly runout measurements were NOT within specifications, proceed to step&nbsp;19.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">If ALL of the tyre and wheel assembly runout measurements WERE within specifications, then the off-vehicle tyre and wheel assembly runout is considered acceptable.</LI>

<BR><IMG src="../../../../graphic-pool/1/76/9/176966.png" alt="176966">
<BR><LI TYPE="1">Position the dial indicator on the horizontal outer surface of the wheel rim flange - with the tyre still mounted - such that the dial indicator is perpendicular to the rim flange surface.</LI>
<p>Wheel runout should be measured on both the inboard and outboard rim flanges, unless wheel design will not permit. Ignore any jumps or dips due to paint drips, chips, or welds.</p>
<LI TYPE="1">Slowly rotate the tyre and wheel assembly one complete revolution in order to find the low spot.</LI>
<LI TYPE="1">Set the dial indicator to zero at the low spot.</LI>
